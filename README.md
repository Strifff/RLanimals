# RLanimals
Reinforcement Learning simulator in Rust.
A simple predator-and-prey simulator where herbivores eat plants and carnivores eats herbivores.

## Goals

- [ ] Reinforcement learning for beasts
- [ ] Concurrent threads for each beast
- [ ] A simple web-based GUI 

## The journey
Brief documentation of has been achieved and how the code works.
### Beasts
